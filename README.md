# Optimal Capital Structure

What is the optimal capital structure for a company?

Should a company launch a new product or expand operations in the current economic environment?  
Or should it start reducing its debt levels to lower financial risk and prepare for potential economic turbulence?

This project explores the theory and practical trade-offs involved in capital structure decisions.  
We analyze when it makes sense to take on more debt, when to rely on equity, and how these choices affect firm value and shareholder wealth.

## Future Work
 This project is to develop a model that dynamically suggests an optimal capital structure (debt-to-equity ratio) based on prevailing market risk levels. 

For example, in low-risk environments, firms might be advised to increase leverage to benefit from cheaper capital. In contrast, during high-risk or volatile periods, the model would shift the recommendation toward higher equity ratios to reduce financial distress risk. This approach could incorporate inputs such as interest rates, volatility indices (e.g., VIX), or macroeconomic indicators to adapt recommendations in real time.
